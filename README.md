# Ros2_Engineering_Log_Book
This engineering logbook provides a standardised, centralised record of project notes, configurations, decisions, and issues. It works alongside GitHub, can be cloned into any workspace, and uploaded with the project, enabling collaboration, traceability, and smooth handover through aligned documentation and code comments.
