# Configuration – Simulation

This file documents configuration required to run and validate the system in a simulated environment. Configuration changes are applied directly to this file. Any behaviour changes resulting from simulation configuration should be recorded in `code_notes.md`.

---

## Dependencies

List critical or non-obvious dependencies required to run the system in simulation.

---

## Environment

Describe the environment in which the simulation is expected to run.

This should include:
- ROS2 distribution
- Operating system
- Simulation tools used
- Assumed execution context (simulation only)

---

## Simulation Settings

Document simulation-specific configuration such as:
- World or environment settings
- Model assumptions
- Timing or physics parameters
- Differences between simulation and real hardware

---

## Docker Container Configuration

Describe container usage for simulation if applicable, or explicitly state that a container is not required.

---

## Configuration Files

List key configuration files that influence simulation behaviour and reference their locations.

---

## Limitations

Document known simulation-specific constraints, assumptions, or
differences from real-world behaviour.
